            <span class="bold">Important:</span>
            If you have not played this mod before you should know a few things beforehand:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li style="margin:0px 0px 12px;">Expect your progress to be slower than in vanilla Minecraft. You will start as a hunter/gatherer and gradually acquire the tools you need to move into the Bronze Age. Agriculture and an Iron Age will follow, and eventually you will enter a Mythic Age where the mining of mithril and adamantium ores becomes possible.</li>
            <li style="margin:0px 0px 12px;">
                Many of the tools and weapons you are used to seeing in vanilla Minecraft (such as wooden swords and wooden pickaxes) have been removed and new ones have been added. It will be helpful for you to peruse the <a href="/web/20170125171022/http://minecraft-is-too-easy.com/crafting_recipes/">Crafting Recipes</a>
                page before jumping in.
            </li>
            <li>
                Survival in the beginning is difficult. It will probably take you many lives to develop a survival strategy and several <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">hours</span>
                days of gameplay to acquire your first metal tools. Be sure to review the in-game Achievements board for direction on what you should do to stay alive. Try to figure things out on your own but if you're still stumped you can always take a look at the <a href="/web/20170125171022/http://minecraft-is-too-easy.com/hints/">hints</a>
                page. The author has also started a <a href="/web/20170125171022/http://minecraft-is-too-easy.com/journal/">journal</a>
                of his own adventures which you might find informative.

    </div>
    <div style="margin:5px;">
        <!--<br />-->
        <p style="margin-top:25px;">MITE does not require Forge, ModLoader, or any other 3rd-party tools. It works best installed onto a fresh copy of vanilla Minecraft.</p>
    </div>
    <div style="margin:5px;">
        <h1 class="underline">Description</h1>
        <p>
            <span class="italic">Minecraft Is Too Easy</span>
            is a stand-alone survival mod that focuses on making the game harder.
        </p>
        <p>For starters, players begin with 3 heart and food icons instead of the standard 10. An extra heart and food icon is awarded with every five levels gained.</p>
    </div>
    <!--<p style="text-align:center;"><img width="720" height="450" alt="Do you have what it takes to survive?" title="Do you have what it takes to survive?" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mite/3.jpg" /></p>-->

    </p>
    <div style="margin:5px;">
        <p>But that's just the beginning. Here are some other changes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Players heal at a slower rate</li>
            <li>Experience is harder to gain; killing peaceful animals no longer provides XPs</li>
            <li>Blocks are harder to break/dig, especially if you're not using an appropriate tool</li>
            <li>Tools wear out more quickly, especially ones made of inferior materials</li>
            <li>Armor provides the same amount of protection but is typically less durable</li>
            <li>The amount of protection armor provides decreases as it becomes damaged</li>
            <li>Both coal and metal ores (more have been added) are harder to find</li>
            <li>Mobs are more aggressive; they can detect players from further away</li>
            <li>The ranged attacks of mobs are more accurate and can hit from a further distance</li>
            <li>A dozen new achievements have been added</li>
            <li>Difficulty is locked on extreme</li>
            <li>Cheats and bonus chest options cannot be enabled</li>
            <li>Some of the standard Minecraft recipes have been tweaked</li>
            <li>Creative mode cannot be entered</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <span class="italic">Minecraft Is Too Easy</span>
            also adds the following features:
        </p>
        <h2>New Metals</h2>
        <ul style="margin-top:0;">
            <li>Copper is probably the first metal you will mine, smelt and make tools with</li>
            <li>Silver provides bonuses vs undead, and some creatures can only be harmed by silver or enchanted weapons</li>
            <li>Mithril is incredibly durable and the smelting of its ore will mark your entry into the Mythic Age</li>

        <h1 class="underline">How Far Have You Gotten?</h1>
        <p>
            MITE is a challenging mod and it's interesting to see how well people have managed to fare while playing it. That's why a thread has been created on the Minecraft Forums where you can share your stories and show off your accomplishments. Survived your first night? Got your first pickaxe? Built your first homestead or village? Post it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170125171022/http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2470117-how-far-have-you-gotten-while-playing-the-minecraft-is-too-easy-mod/">here</a>

        <h1 class="underline">Regarding MITE for Minecraft 1.7.x and Beyond</h1>
        <p>MITE is a large mod and updating it to 1.7.x or 1.8.x will take a lot of work (probably several months of full-time coding and playtesting). I'm not closed to the idea but at the same time I don't feel it has a large enough audience to justify the time and energy required. This could change in the future, of course.</p>
        <p>Until then enjoy MITE for Minecraft 1.6.4!</p>
        <!--<h1 class="underline">Help MITE Grow</h1>
        <p>There are some things you can do if you enjoy this mod and would like to support it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Post any questions or comments you have about MITE on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2467282-164-minecraft-is-too-easy-mite-mod/">forum</a> (keep the forum active!)</li>
            <li>Mention this mod in your blog or tweet about it</li>
            <li>Tell your friends about MITE, or better yet start a server and invite them</li>
            <li>Improve the wiki by adding new pages and useful information</li>
            <li>Use social media to promote MITE (there is a social media page <a rel="nofollow" href="norobots/social_media.php">here</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Anything you can do to give this mod more exposure and help enlarge its audience will go a long way to supporting continued development.</p>-->
